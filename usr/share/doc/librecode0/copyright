This is the Debian prepackaged version of Free recode, a program that
converts files between character sets and usages. Free recode was
written by Fran√ßois Pinard <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>.

This package was first put together by Klee Dienes <klee@mit.edu>.

It is currently maintained by Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>,
from sources obtained from:

http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/recode/recode-3.6.tar.gz

The changes were fairly minimal, and consisted solely of adding
various debian/* files to the distribution.
